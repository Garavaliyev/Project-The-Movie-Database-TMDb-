# Project-The-Movie-Database-TMDb-

In this project, we will focus on the dataset of The Movie Database(TMDb). The data set has information about Revenue, rating, vote, budget and genres etc. from 10.000 movies.
First of all, we assess and clean the data set, and drop some columns which are less important for our Research questions. 
At first time, we import all important packages which are more useful for our project. After that we make the data wrangling, cleaning, Explotary data analysis with visualization and A/B testing to find answers for our Research questions.

Our Research questions are below:

1. Which genres are most popular from year to year?
2. What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?
3. Are there relationship between higher vote and budget?
